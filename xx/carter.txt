Howard Carter's doodle was so much fun to work on! Researching it and diving into his writing was a claustrophobic process in itself. The rich, detailed account and the anticipation of when he finally chiseled away at the tomb sent chills down my spine... so much so that I couldn't wait to read more. I now seriously hope to visit Tut's tomb someday.

Below are two concepts which only attempt to match this monumental discovery. The first sketch attempts to capture that 'claustrophobic' feeling (almost cinematic) with the help of reference photos. In the numerous photos that are out there there were pulley systems supporting Tut's golden resting place, beams that supported the structure and a very cool lamp that looked like it was, well from an Indiana Jones movie... but I guess the influence was the other way around :)
